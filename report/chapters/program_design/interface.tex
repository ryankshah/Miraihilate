Before starting to develop and implement Miraihilate, I first designed wireframe mockups to decide what the interface would look like before implementation. The wireframes were designed in \href{https://balsamiq.com}{Balsamiq}, and will be used to gain initial feedback on the layout of the design rather than usability, before designing a working prototype for usability feedback.

\subsection{Mockup Design}

The mockups that I designed for this initial feedback are of primary components of the system which users have the most interaction with. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Client Interface}
	\item{Advanced Scanning}
	\item{Scan Logs}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pre-Implementation}

Conclude the study and above design choices, to flow into the
implementation section.

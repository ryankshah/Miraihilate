A Denial-of-Service (DoS)\textsuperscript{\cite{douligeris2004ddos}} attack is a type of network attack, that is designed to take down a network. It does this by flooding it with useless traffic so it crashes. It makes it extremely difficult or impossible for legitimate users to use resources. Whilst an attack that crashes a server can be successful, it can be solved by rebooting the system. However, \textit{flooding} attacks can be a more difficult task for recovery.

The main motive behind DoS attacks is to cause harm to an individual or organisation. However, DoS attacks are usually not large enough to cause substantial damage to an organisation. Therefore, many high-profile DoS attacks are distributed. This means that the traffic outbound to a network is directed from multiple systems performing the attack. An attack originating from multiple sources is far more difficult to detect and defend against because it is harder to differentiate the traffic with malicious intent from legitimate traffic into the network.

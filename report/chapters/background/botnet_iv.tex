In order to create a substantial botnet, a botmaster must initially
distribute bot malware to the device. Then bots can also individually
spread the malware to other devices, as well as the botmaster themselves\textsuperscript{\cite{atluri2017botnets}}.

While some malware while have a direct impact on the user of the vulnerable
device, botnet malware can take on different levels of visibility. However,
it tends to attempt running silently or with minimal disruption to avoid
detection.

Botnets recruit additional bots through a variety of different attack/infection
vectors. Pathways for infection include, but are not limited to: website vulnerabilities
and silent drive-bys, Remote Administration Trojan (RAT) malware and weak authentication.
Once access has been obtained, the result involves the bot malware being installed and
allows the botmaster full remote control of the device.

Once the device is infected, it may self-propagate the botnet and re-distribute the bot
malware to other vulnerable devices.

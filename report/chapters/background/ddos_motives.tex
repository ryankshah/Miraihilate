It is often difficult to establish an attackers motives when they perform a DDoS attack, and sometimes people never learn what motivated the attack, but any organisation or individual can be targeted.

One motive that drives attackers to perform a DDoS attack is ideological or political reasons. They target websites, individuals and/or organisations they disagree with ideologically.

Businesses can also use DDoS attacks to strategically impair or take down competing business websites, possibly keeping them from participating in a significant business-related event.

Attackers can also DDoS or threaten with DDoS attacks as a means of extorting money or other assets from their targets.

Another motive is cyber warfare. Authorized attacks, such as those authorized by a government official, can be used to cripple opposing websites or even an enemy country's infrastructure.

Finally, boredom is another main motive for performing a DDoS attack. Individuals may use pre-coded scripts to launch attacks, or even use a free minor DDoS service, looking for a small adrenaline rush or even as an attempt to impress friend groups.

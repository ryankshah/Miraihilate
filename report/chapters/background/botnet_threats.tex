Given the potential scale of botnets and vast amounts of damage they
can cause, prevention of threats posed by them is imperative.

Research has shown\textsuperscript{\cite{fabian2007my}} that a botnet network consisting of a small number of infected devices doesn't \textit{necessarily} pose much of a threat, but some of the largest botnets range from thousands to millions of bots. Such large botnets have the desired resources to perform malicious actions on a high-scale\textsuperscript{\cite{symantecbotnetthreats}}, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mass email spam, flooding millions of inboxes in a matter of seconds
	\item DDoS attacks, crashing entire websites
	\item Parallel brute-force hacking techniques
	\item Identity theft and internet fraud
\end{itemize}

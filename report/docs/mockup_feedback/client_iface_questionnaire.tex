\textbf{1.} On a scale from 1 to 10, how clear would you consider the above interface to be?

\begin{center}
	\begin{table}[h]
	\label{my-label}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXXXXXXXXX}
	\multicolumn{5}{l}{Unclear} & \multicolumn{5}{r}{Clear} \\
	\centering
	1    & 2    & 3    & 4    & 5    & 6    & 7    & 8    & 9    & 10
	\end{tabularx}
	\end{table}
\end{center}

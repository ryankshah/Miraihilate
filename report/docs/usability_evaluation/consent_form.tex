	\textbf{Project:} Building and testing a white-hat botnet checker for evaluating the effectiveness of Mirai against other botnet malware
\end{center}

The objective of the experiment is to provide feedback on wireframes of the initial primary components of the botnet checker program. The experiment will involve completing \textbf{three} short questionnaires, which entail reviewing a wireframe image of the interface component and answering short questions about the design and placement of elements on the interfaces.

All results will be held in strict confidence, ensuring the privacy of all participants. There will be no record kept that would allow your results to be tracked back to you. All data will also be held securely in a locked office. A feedback sheet (containing summaries of the data mentioned above) will be sent to all participants who request it, after the data has been analysed. Your participation in this experiment will have no effect on your marks for any subject at this, or any other university.

You may withdraw from the experiment at any time without prejudice, and any data already recorded will be deleted.
